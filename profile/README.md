Infrastructure for news organizations with a bottom line. Because news should be about reporting, not software.

The key thing that I think that there might be a market for is twitter/facebook/instagram/doomscrolling clones, and I think that there is room for lots of players in the arena with lots of different feed algorithms. I am interested in setting up the infrastructure for those players to succeed, differentiating themselves on their algorithms rather than the whole technological suite.

I'm actively looking for help and feedback on the overall design and implementation strategy before I start rolling anything out.
