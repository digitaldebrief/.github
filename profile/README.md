Infrastructure for news organizations with a bottom line. Because news should be about reporting, not software. 

The BlueSky AT Protocol is great, and is the target for most of the news aggregation done by this blogging infrastructure. Once I have my own software put together, I'll help out with integrating it into a PDS and feed generator at multiple levels. First comes security, though.

This organization is about writing posts with good infosec, because privacy is an important part of good reporting. Unlike BlueSky and ATProto, this infrastructure does not assume open and perminant all of the time. It goes into the gray zone of limited visibility and shared editability. It's confusing, it's complicated, and there will be more than one solution out there. This one is mine.
